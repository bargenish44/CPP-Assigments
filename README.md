### 1) Linux Compilation Test

This script helps us debugging (checks compilation , Memory leaks and thread race) cpp files.

What is valgrind?

What is thread race?

# 2) Binary search tree

what is binary search tree and how it works?

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-data-structure/

this mission represents hpp and cpp files of binary tree,more of that is some simple test functions.

for now,this program can give some better ways to write begginer's binary tree examples.

# 3) Operators

This repository present simple using in operators in cpp language.
according to the operators tutorial and my code ,everyone can see the 
operator's importance in it using.
this function (operator) give us the abillity to basic actions on complicate 
objects in our code.

An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C++ is rich in built-in operators and provide the following types of operators −

    Arithmetic Operators
    Relational Operators
    Logical Operators
    Bitwise Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Misc Operators

This chapter will examine the arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment and other operators one by one.


# 4) Bull Pgia

present a simple BULL PGIA in cpp.

BULL PGIA is a game, this game learn (basic information) about machine's self learning.

The numerical version of the game is usually played with 4 digits, but can also be played with 3 or any other number of digits.

On a sheet of paper, the players each write a 4-digit secret number. The digits must be all different. Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number who gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows". Example:

. Secret number: 4271 . Opponent's try: 1234 . Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)

The first one to reveal the other's secret number wins the game. As the first player has a logical advantage, the game can be balanced over multiple games by alternating the right to go first, or over a single game by granting the second player an equal number of guesses, possibly resulting in a tie.

The game may also be played by two teams of 2–3 players, with the team members discussing their strategy before selecting a move.

A computer program moo, written in 1970 by J. M. Grochow at MIT in the PL/I computer language for the Multics operating system, was amongst the first Bulls and Cows computer implementations, inspired by a similar program written by Frank King in 1968 and running on the Cambridge University mainframe. Because the game has simple rules, while it is difficult and entertaining, there are many computer variants; it is often included in telephones and PDAs.

It is proven that any number could be solved within seven turns. Minimal average game length is 26274/5040=5.2131 turns.[1][2]


# 5) Itertools


This project represent iterable class.

We build 5 containers:

### range :

Used as a more readable equivalent to the traditional for loop operating over a range of values, such as all elements in a container.

### chain :

represent combining between 2 containers (include string).

### zip :

represent parallel connection between 2 containers.

### product : 

represent Cartesian product between 2 containers.

### powerset :

represent all the sub-groups of container.

### what is iterable?

allows an object to be the target of the "foreach" statement.
